# Corporation as Code

Rethinking corporate records for the digital age.

**Corporation as code** is a model in which the legal entity is natively represented as a structured, version-controlled data object rather than as a collection of documents. Corporate attributes (ownership, governance rules, historical actions, and organizational relationships) are expressed as standardized data structures, with traditional documents functioning as human-readable views generated from an authoritative computational source.
